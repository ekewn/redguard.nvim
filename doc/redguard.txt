2. Usage                                                   *redguard-usage*

    To use the default settings, just apply the theme

    If you are using Vim-Script:
        colorscheme redguard~

    If you are using Lua:
        require('redguard').set~


    redguard also includes a Lualine theme. Set it in your Lualine config
        require('lualine').setup {~
          options = {~
            -- ... your lualine config
            theme = 'redguard'~
            -- ... your lualine config
          }~
        }~
    Just make sure to set the theme to "redguard", as "redguard" already
    exist built in to lualine
    
    If the lualine's background has become transparent, make sure that
    lualine setup is being called after the redguard theme has been applied.
